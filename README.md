#### The landing page image:
The landing page for Pawesome includes a picture of a small puppy, easter bunny and a pink frame with text overlay where users can see the information about limited Easter Discount.
The goal for the landing page picture is to show the purpose of what Pawesome is about and welcome the user with a cute puppy and an interesting Easter Deal.

#### Why Pawesome is Awesome section:
-The Why Pawesome is Awesome section consists of 3 separate images, each one with a hover overlay - effect.
-The idea behind this is to give some additional information to the user about why they should choose Pawesome before anyone else. 
-When the user hovers over each image there’s a different text overlay behind them that states that Pawesome takes the best care of their pet, being gentle with all the animals and using cruelty free products only.
#### Grooming Packages Section
This section has 3 different images of different dog breeds and a separate text under each one.
The idea is to describe all the grooming packages that Pawesome has to offer with short and clear sentences and corresponding images to give the user some visual idea when they are choosing a package for their pet.
#### Contact Page
The contact page includes two containers in blue color, same color code as in the Pawesome logo.
The left container is a form that users can fill out their name, e-mail address, select a package, specify a time and date for the grooming session and specify if they have any additional requests that we can help them with. 
The form container is made in a way so all the fields are required to be filled except the last field before submitting.
The right container has the same blue color code from the Pawesome logo and shows a Map with the location of Pawesome.
#### About Us Page
The about us page has an image of a yellow and black cat and a bubble chat box with some text overlay inside of it. In the bottom section of the page there is a video of a before/after grooming section of a Samoyed Dog.
The idea for this section is to familiarize the user a little bit with Pawesome’s background and how long they are in the same business and also to give the user some security that they are giving their pet in the right hands. 
The idea behind the before/after video of a dog grooming session is that it gives the users a fun way to see what Pawesome is capable of.
#### Footer
The footer has a simple and minimalistic design with the same pink color code from the Pawesome logo.
It gives the users informations about Open Hours, links to Pawesome’s social media and the location.
